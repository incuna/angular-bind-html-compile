# angular-bind-html-compile
This repo contains a bower package that provides an angular directive which can be passed trusted html with angular template content to evaluate.

The `bind-html-compile` directive allows for HTML containing directives to be compiled.

You should only use this directive where the content is coming from a trusted
source.

## Install
Install via [bower](http://bower.io)

* `bower install angular-bind-html-compile`

Add dependency to your app module

* `'angular-bind-html-compile'`

## Usage 
Just like the standard `ng-bind-html`, `bind-html-compile` goes like this:
```
<div bind-html-compile="data.content"></div>
```

(However, unlike the standard `ng-bind-html`, `bind-html-compile` compiles directives!)

`template-url` attribute can be used to load a template file:
```
<div bind-html-compile template-url="data.templateUrl"></div>
```
or a static path:
```
<div bind-html-compile template-url="'partials/myTemplate.html'"></div>
```

Also both attributes can be used together for loading a "piece of html code" as well as a "template file":
```
<div bind-html-compile="data.content" template-url="data.templateUrl"></div>
```

## Development
* Contributions welcome - Create an issue to discuss proposed changes and additions
* All contributions should be done in branches and submitted as pull requests.
* Code style follows the [jsHint](http://jshint.com/docs/) and [jscs](http://jscs.info/) rules in `.jshintrc` and `jscsrc`. Automated travis tests will fail if these are not adhered to.
